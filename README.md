<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims to build a medium like blog posting platform which any organisation, specially colleges with different clubs posting over their publication/Club Board, can use for regularly posting out information/updates and interesting posts with easy to use Rich Text Editor. React is used to make a Dynamic Webapp with JWT Authentication for login/logout. Further, in the project I have implemented login/logout - register - profile and dynamic post content with both frontend and backend. [Link](https://pulkit1joshi.github.io/medfrontend/).
